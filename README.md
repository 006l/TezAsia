-   Project Description：
	 -  The voiceprint NFT implements the style transformation for voice, which can converse male voices to female voices, or ordinary vocal content into celebrity voices. We will provide a rich target sound library, while the sound in the library will be mint as a voiceprint NFT, voiceprint NFT holders can arbitrarily choose their own desired timbre for voice conversion,to show their personality and characteristics in the Mataverse. In the early stage, we will provide Chinese and English voice conversion, and further provide small language conversion to meet the needs of users around the world, while providing celebrity voiceprint NFTs, we will also provide voiceprint NFTs of non-human characters in famous film and television dramas, such as Gollum in "The Lord of the Rings", Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and Sonic in "Transformers".

   
-   Inspiration：
	-  In the future, users will also be allowed to upload their own voice to make a voiceprint NFT to mint their own voiceprint NFT works, and earn value by selling or renting. The product we provide is not only a voiceprint conversion tool, but also a comprehensive platform that will mining users' voice talent, creativity and self-presentation. The users can not only use it as an external expression form of their own metaverse, but also become the creators of sounds in the metaverse. Voiceprint NFT contains vivid timbre, rich emotions, and makes it possible to express all this intuitively. Then the users can be heard and felt by the whole world.
